Widget List
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the convenience of writing code, this chapter will introduce the use of various
widgets on Sunfounder Controller, the parameter types and ranges of control widgets,
and the parameter types and ranges of display widgets.

The control widgets of Sunfounder Controller include buttons, switches, joystick,
cross-shaped steering wheel, and slider.

You can modify the widget name and the parameter range of some widgets by clicking 
the icon in the upper right corner of the widget.

The display widget of Sunfounder Controller includes digital displays, dial, ultrasonic
radar, and grayscale detection tool.

When we send sensor data to these display widgets, we can display the data on the
corresponding widgets. At the same time, you can also modify the name, unit and
parameter range of the display widget by clicking the icon in the upper right
corner.

Establish communication
------------------------

In addition to the code control method, we also provide the APP control method.
You can open Sunfounder Controller on mobile phones, tablets and other devices,
and then make a controller to control ESP-4WD Car.

Run the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the ``ws.py`` file in the MicroPython device.

.. image:: img/python_app1.png
  :width: 180
  :align: center

AP mode
^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to establish communication between Sunfounder Controller
and ESP32 RDP: One is AP mode, the other is STA mode. We can switch the 
communication mode by modifying the code of ws.py.

If you want to use AP mode, you need to connect Sunfounder Contorller to the hotspot released by ESP32 RDP. 
Move the code to line 10, please set SSID and PSK here. If you have more than one EPS-4WD Cars, you need to 
set different NAMEs for them to avoid a wrong connection. In addition, you need to set a password of more
than 8 digits.

.. code-block:: python

    NAME = 'ESP-4WD Car'
    AP_PASSWORD = "123456789"

Then modify the content of line 10 and define the ``SWITCH_MODE`` variable as "ap".

.. code-block:: python

    SWITCH_MODE = "ap"

After downloading the code, ESP32 RDP will send a hotspot signal, then take out your
electronic device, open the WLAN management interface and connect to the wifi
network.

.. image:: img/arduino_app12.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center

Open Sunfounder Controller and click the Connect icon on the top right.

.. image:: img/arduino_app_new1.png
  :width: 300
  :align: center

A prompt box will appear if the connection is successful.

.. image:: img/arduino_app_new2.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center

And the name of the car will be displayed on APP.

.. image:: img/arduino_app_new3.png
  :width: 300
  :align: center

STA mode
^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use AP mode, you need to connect Sunfounder Controller and ESP32 RDP to the same LAN.
Turn the code to line 12, there are two macros that define the wifi information. ESP32
RDP will search for and connect to this wifi, and at the same time your electronic
device should connect to this wifi.

.. code-block:: python

    STA_NAME = "MakerStarsHall"
    STA_PASSWORD = "sunfounder"

Then modify the content of line 14 and define the ``SWITCH_MODE`` variable as "sta".

.. code-block:: python

    SWITCH_MODE = "sta"

After downloading the code, ESP32 RDP will automatically connect to the wifi network, and at the same time take out your electronic device, open the WLAN management interface 
and connect to this wifi network.

.. image:: img/arduino_app13_.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center

Open Sunfounder Controller and click the Connect icon on the top right.

.. image:: img/arduino_app_new1.png

  :align: center

Find the car name in the pop-up window and click on it.

.. image:: img/arduino_app_new4.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center

After connecting, the name of the car will be displayed on APP.

DIY Remote Control
-------------------------

If you want to DIY a new remote control, you need to understand the communication process between the ESP32 RDP and the Sunfounder Controller. 
Open the ``test_control.py file`` . You will go through this code to see how they communicate with each other.

Program framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, let us understand the general operating framework of the program.

Turn the code to line 34. In the ``main()`` function, we have written the basic
implementation code for build a controller.

``ws.start()`` : Establish communication between ESP-4WD RDP and Sunfounder
Controller.

``result = read()`` : Read the received data and store it in the result variable.

``write()`` ï¼šSend sensor data to Sunfounder Controller.

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        ws.start()
        print("start")
        while True:
            result = read()
            if result != None:
                # coding the control function here.
                
                # coding the sensor function here.
                
                # ws.send_dict['L_region'] = car.get_grayscale_list() # example for test sensor date sending.
                write()
            time.sleep_ms(15)

Open the ``ws.py`` file, turn the code to line 87, in the ``start()`` function, we switch the
communication mode by judging the value of ``SWITCH_MODE`` .

.. code-block:: python

    def start(self):
        if SWITCH_MODE == "ap":
            self.wlan = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF)
            self.wlan.config(essid=AP_NAME, authmode=4, password=AP_PASSWORD)
            self.wlan.active(True)  # turning on the hotspot
        elif SWITCH_MODE == "sta":
            self.wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
            self.wlan.active(True)
            self.wlan.connect(STA_NAME, STA_PASSWORD)

Receiving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ESP32 RDP receives data from the Sunfounder Controller and sends its own sensor data to the Sunfounder Controller.
Let's find out what data ESP32 RDP receives from Sunfounder Controller.

**Step 1: Create a remote control**

Run the ``test_control.py`` file, re-establish communication, and then open Sunfounder Controller to create 
a new controller. We add a slider in the H area and a cross-shaped steering wheel in the K area. After
adding, click the icon in the upper right corner to save.

.. image:: img/arduino_app16.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center

**Step 2: Received values**

Turn the code to line 14, in the ``read()`` function, we realized the receiving and printing
of the data sent by the Sunfounder Controller. The function of the temp variable is to
prevent repeated printing of data.

.. code-block:: python

    def read():
        global temp
        recv = ws.read()
        if recv == None:
            return
        recv_data = json.loads(recv)
        if temp != recv_data:
            print("recv_data: %s\n"%recv_data)
            temp = recv_data        
        return recv_data

Receive the Json object sent by Sunfounder Controller through the ``ws.read()``
function and store it in the ``recv`` variable.

.. code-block:: python

    recv = ws.read()

Parse ``recv`` variable (Json object format) into ``recv_data`` dictionary through the
``json.loads( )`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    recv_data = json.loads(recv)

Print ``recv_data`` variable.

.. code-block:: python

    print("recv_data: %s\n"%recv_data)

Click the start icon in the upper right corner to run the controller.

.. image:: img/arduino_app17.png
  :width: 250
  :align: center

Open the Shell window under Thonny, we can find that the initial data of K
control is the string "stop", and the initial data of H widget is the int value 50.

.. image:: img/arduino_app18.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center

Press the arrow keys of the cross-shaped steering wheel in the K area and slide the slider in the H area.

.. image:: img/arduino_app19.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center

You can see that the cross-shaped steering
wheel widget sends a string of data ("forward", "backward", "left", "right") to the ESP-
4WD RDP. The slider widget will send an int data (range: 0-100) to the ESP-4WD RDP.

.. image:: img/arduino_app20.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
    
**Step 3: Response**

When ESP-4WD Car receives data from different controls of Sunfounder Controller, it needs to respond accordingly.
Letâ€™s write a piece of code that uses the widgets on the Sunfounder Controller 
to control the movement of the car. The K widget(cross-shaped steering wheel) controls
the direction of the car, and the H widget(slider) controls the speed of the car.

Turn the code to line 43, we add the following code in this line.

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        ws.start()
        print("start")
        while True:
            result = read()
            if result != None:
                car.move(result['K_region'], result['H_region'                
                # ws.send_dict['L_region'] = car.get_grayscale_list() # example for test sensor date sending.
                write()
            time.sleep_ms(15)

Through the ``read()`` function, you can receive the data sent by Sunfounder
Controller and store it in the result dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    result = read()

The value of ``doc_recv["K_region"]`` is the string data ("forward", "backward","left",
"right") sent by the K widget (cross-shaped steering wheel), the same as the value of
``doc_recv["H_region"]`` is the int data sent by H widget (slide) (range: 0-100).

Pass ``doc_recv["K_region"]`` as the first parameter to the ``car.move()`` function to control
the direction of the ESP-4WD Car. Pass ``doc_recv["H_region"]`` as the second parameter
to the ``car.move()`` function to control the speed of ESP-4WD Car.

.. code-block:: python

    car.move(result['K_region'], result['H_region'])

After downloading the modified code and re-establishing communication, open the
controller and click the start icon in the upper right corner to run the controller.
The cross-shaped steering wheel in the K area can control the direction of the ESP-
4WD Car, and the slider in the H area can control the speed of the ESP-4WD Car.

Sending
^^^^^^^^^

Let's take a closer look at how the ESP32 RDP sends its own sensor data to the Sunfounder Controller.

**Step 1: Create a remote control**

Open the **ws.py** file and turn the code to line 25. Here, the equipment information and proofreading 
information of ESP-4WD Car are stored in the ``send_dict`` dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    send_dict = {
        'Name':AP_NAME,
        'Type':'ESP-4WD Car',
        'Check':'SunFounder Controller',
        }

Open the **test_control.py** file and turn the code to line 44, delete the comment symbol for this code. 
Obtain the grayscale sensor data through the ``car.get_grayscale_list()`` function and store it in the
``ws.send_dict`` dictionary with the key 'L_region'.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 7

  def main():
      ws.start()
      print("start")
      while True:
          result = read()
          if result != None:                
              ws.send_dict['L_region'] = car.get_grayscale_list()
              write()
          time.sleep_ms(15)

Turn the code to line 44, through the ``write()`` function, we send sensor data to the Sunfounder Controller, 
where the ``temp_send`` variable is used to prevent repeated printing of data.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 3,5

  def write():
      global temp_send
      ws.write(json.dumps(ws.send_dict))
      if temp_send != ws.send_dict:
          print("send_data:%s\n"%ws.send_dict)
          temp_send = ws.send_dict.copy
      return

First, use the ``json.dumps()`` function to convert the ``ws.send_dict`` dictionary into
a Json object, and then use the ``ws.write()`` function to send the ``Json`` object storing the
sensor data to the Sunfounder Controller.

.. code-block:: python

    ws.write(json.dumps(ws.send_dict))

Print the value of the ``ws.send_dict`` dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    print("send_data:%s\n"%ws.send_dict)

Download this code again, and turn on the controller after establishing communication.

Open the Shell window under Thonny, you will see that the ESP-4WD RDP has been 
sending device information, calibration information and the value of the grayscale 
sensor to the Sunfounder Controller.

.. image:: img/arduino_app22.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center

**Step 3: Response**

Let's write a piece of code that display the sensor data of ESP-4WD RDP on the
widget of Sunfounder Controller. Widget D (grayscale detection tool) will show you the grayscale of the ground.

Turn the code to line 34, Let's re-explain the content of the ``main()`` event. 

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 6,7

  def main():
      ws.start()
      print("start")
      while True:
          result = read()
          if result != None:               
              ws.send_dict['L_region'] = car.get_grayscale_list()
              write()
          time.sleep_ms(15)

By ``car.get_grayscale_list()`` function, we can get the list of grayscale sensor detection values and assign them to ``ws.send_dict['L_region']``.

.. code-block:: python

    ws.send_dict['L_region'] = car.get_grayscale_list()

Send sensor data, device information and proofreading information of the ESP-4WD RDP 
to Sunfounder Controller through ``write()`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    write()

Back in the remote control interface, Widget D (grayscale detection tool) is showing the current ground conditions, if you want to know more about the controls, please go back to
Widget List to see.
