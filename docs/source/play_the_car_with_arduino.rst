Play the Car with Arduino
==========================

There are two ways for arduino users to learn and play the ESP-4WD car: Code Control and APP Control.
You can directly use arduino code to control the car, or DIY a remote control.

It should be noted that before using APP Control, you need to understand Code Control first.
