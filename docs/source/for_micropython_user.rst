For MicroPython User
==========================


Welcome to the guide for the ESP-4WD car Kit (MicroPython version). 

In this chapter, you will learn to burn firmware to the ESP32 RDP, install Thonny IDE, test all the components before assembling and then complete the assembly of the car.
Once assembled, use the Arduino code to make the car do some interesting applications.

In addition you can use an APP, the SunFounder Controller, to visually control or access the individual data of the car.
